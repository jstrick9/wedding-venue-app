/**
 * Re-enabled smoke test (was previously skipped with `describe.skip`).
 *
 * Two of the three contracts the original test wanted to assert can now run
 * here without hanging jsdom:
 *   1. Renders the LoginScreen when there is no session.
 *   2. Renders the GuestPortal route when the URL hash points at it.
 *
 * The third contract — "AuthenticatedApp mounts and the typed event bus opens
 * the Decor Designer" — is still too heavy to mount under jsdom because
 * `useLayoutState` + `Header` + `Sidebar` + `FloorPlanCanvas` together pull in
 * thousands of LOC of SVG / canvas code that JSDOM struggles with.  That
 * contract is still covered, but at the right granularity:
 *
 *   - `src/utils/appEvents.test.ts`         — typed bus delivery contract
 *   - `src/hooks/useAppModals.test.ts`      — modal opener subscribes & flips
 *     state when `spm_open_decor_designer` fires (regression test for the
 *     original Decor Designer bug)
 *   - `src/components/DecorDesigner.test.tsx` — the modal itself works once
 *     mounted (multi-select, duplicate, rulers, keyboard shortcuts)
 *
 * Together those three files prove the same end-to-end contract that an
 * AuthenticatedApp render would, without paying jsdom's full mount cost.
